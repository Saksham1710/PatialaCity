        <h1><u><b>History</b></u></h1>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qila_Mubarak%2C_Patiala"><img src="Images/PATIALA,QILLA_MUBARAK.jpeg" alt="quila" width="500px" height="auto" title="Quila Mubarak"></a>
        <p class="first">  Patiala state was 
            established in 1763 by Ala Singh, a Jat Sikh chieftain, who laid the foundation of the Patiala fort 
            known as Qila Mubarak, around 'which the present city of Patiala is built. After the Third Battle of 
            Panipat in 1761 in which the Marathas were defeated by the Afghans, the writ of the Afghans prevailed 
            throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. 
            The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless power struggle with the Afghan Durrani Empire, 
            Maratha Empire and the Sikh Empire of Lahore.</p>

            <p class="first">In 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the British against Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit 
            Singh of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire building process by the British 
            in, the sub-continent of India. Patiala became a 17-guns salute state during the British Raj. The rulers 
            of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, Mahendra Singh, Rajinder Singh, Bhupinder Singh, and 
            Yadvindra Singh were treated with respect and dignity by the British.</p>
           <p class="first"> The city of Patiala was designed and developed according to a plan akin to that of temple architecture, 
            the first settlers of Patiala were the Hindus of Sirhind, who opened their business establishments outside 
            the Darshani Gate.The royal house is now headed by Captain Amarinder Singh The royals are considered cultural and political 
            icons in east Punjab.Maharaja Karam Singh who ruled from 1813 to 1845 (the Sikh Kingdom of Patiala in Punjab) joined the 
            British East India Company and helped the British during the First Anglo Sikh wars against the Sikh Empire 
            of Maharajah Ranjit Singh of Punjab which was larger and extended from Tibet Kashmir, plains of Punjab to 
            Peshawar near the Afghan borders.</p>

        <p>According to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the Gurdwara, one Bhag Ram, a Jhivar of Lehal, waited upon ninth Guru of Sikhs Guru Tegh Bahadur during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh).
             He requested that the Guru might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its inhabitants could be rid of a severe and mysterious sickness that had been their bane for a long time.</p>
           <p> The Guru visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a banyan tree by the side of a pond.
                The sickness in the village subsided.
                The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as Dukh Nivaran, literally meaning eradicator of suffering. 
                Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the Sarovar attached to the shrine. It is still believed that any illness can be cured by 'ishnaan' on five consecutive Panchami.
